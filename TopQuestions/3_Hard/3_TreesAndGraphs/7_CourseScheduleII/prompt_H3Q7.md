# [Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-hard/118/trees-and-graphs/848/)

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[k] = [aₖ, bₖ]` indicates that you **must** take course `bₖ` first if you want to take course `aₖ`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return *the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses*. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
- `prerequisites[k].length == 2`
- `0 <= aₖ, bₖ < numCourses`
- `aₖ != bₖ`
- All the pairs `[aₖ, bₖ]` are distinct.

This problem is equivalent to finding the topological order in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.

Topological sort could also be done via [BFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Algorithms).
