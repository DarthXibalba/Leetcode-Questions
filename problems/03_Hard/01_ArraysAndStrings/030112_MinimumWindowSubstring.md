# [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-hard/116/array-and-strings/838/)
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window substring** of* `s` *such that every character in* `t` ***(including duplicates)** is included in the window*.

If there is no such substring, return *the empty string* `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

#### Constraints:
- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

#### Follow up:
Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

<details>
<summary><b>Hint #1</b></summary>
Use two pointers to create a window of letters in s, which would have all the characters from t.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hint #2</b></summary>
Expand the right pointer until all the characters of t are covered.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hint #3</b></summary>
Once all the characters are covered, move the left pointer and ensure that all the characters are still covered to minimize the subarray size.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hint #4</b></summary>
Continue expanding the right and left pointers until you reach the end of s.
