There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly to city `c`.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `iᵗʰ` city and `jᵗʰ` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return *the total number of **provinces***.

#### Example 1:
<img src="images/030305_graph1.jpg">

```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:
<img src="images/030305_graph2.jpg">

```
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `n == isConnected.length`
- `n == isConnected[i].length`
- `isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.
- `isConnected[i][i] == 1`
- `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`
